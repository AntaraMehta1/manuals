g++

-shared
    Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.  Not all
    systems support this option.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options used
    for compilation (-fpic, -fPIC, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.[1]

-fPIC
    If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and
    avoiding any limit on the size of the global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k,
    PowerPC and SPARC.

    Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works only on certain machines.

    When this flag is set, the macros "__pic__" and "__PIC__" are defined to 2.
