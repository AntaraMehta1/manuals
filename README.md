# manuals


This repository is a collection of:
- software manuals
- template code
- various tips and tricks
- possible pitfalls, and
- references
- demonstration notebooks

for different tools and packages.


**Motivation:**
- When encountering a new method I try to document its usage, so that next time I encounter it, I
  don't need to spend time on googleing it again.
- Document the solution for specific problems.
- Contain references to the relevant part in the official documentation and/or stackoverflow posts.


**Note:**
- If the function has a comprehensive official documentation you might just find the copy-pasted
  version of the relevant section, supplementing it with my own boilerplate code & tips.
