# manuals

This repository is a collection of:
- software manuals
- template code
- various tips and tricks
- possible pitfalls
- references
- demonstration notebooks

for different programming languages, tools and packages.


**Motivation for collecting these manuals:**
- To enable fast look up of code recipes.
- To offload the burden on the limited, active working memory.
- Contain references to the relevant part in the official documentation and/or other informative posts.
- To have ready-made solutions for niche problems/features, which don't necessarily have a solution
  that are retrievable with a quick online search.
