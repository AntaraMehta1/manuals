# `RooFit`

The RooFit packages provide a toolkit for modeling the expected distribution of events in a physics
analysis. Models can be used to perform likelihood fits, produce plots, and generate "toy Monte
Carlo" samples for various studies. The RooFit tools are integrated with the object-oriented and
interactive ROOT graphical environment.

RooFit has been developed for the BaBar collaboration, a high energy physics experiment at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and is primarily targeted to the high-energy physicists using
the ROOT analysis environment, but the general nature of the package make it suitable for adoption
in different disciplines as well.
