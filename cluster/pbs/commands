## Specifying resources within the job script ##

It can be tedious and error-prone typing the resource requirements on the qsub
command line, so you may prefer to specify them in the job script itself.
Default resource requirements can be defined within a job script by including a
line begining with "#PBS" near the beginning of the script - before the first
executable line (these are called PBS "directives"). If my_script contained the
two lines

###################
### - Options - ###
###################

#PBS -l walltime=30:00:00
#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=16

# - Name
 -N name
Declares a name  for the job. The name specified may be up to and including
15 characters in length.  It must consist of printable, non white space
characters with the first character alphabetic.

If the -N option is not specified, the job name will be the base name of the
job script file specified on the command line. If no script file name was
specified and the script was read from the standard input, then the job name
will be set to STDIN.

#it would request 2 nodes for 30 hours when submitted with:

qsub my_script

#but any resource specified by a directive can be overridden by the resources
#specified on the qsub command line.
