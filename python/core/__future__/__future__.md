Purpose of the `__future__` module:

- To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze `import` statements and expect
	to find the modules theyâ€™re importing.

- To ensure that future statements run under releases prior to 2.1 at least
	yield runtime exceptions (the import of `__future__` will fail, because there was
	no module of that name prior to 2.1).

- To document when incompatible changes were introduced, and when they will be
	- or were - made mandatory. This is a form of executable documentation, and can
	be inspected programmatically via importing `__future__` and examining its
	contents.
