MG5_aMC>tutorial aMCatNLO
tutorial_aMCatNLO:
        You have entered tutorial mode. This will introduce you to the main
        syntax options of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO for the computation of processes involving
        NLO corrections.

        To learn more about the different options for a command, you can use
        MG_aMC>help A_CMD
        To see a list of all commands, use
        MG_aMC>help

        The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to generate a process and to
        produce an output for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. In this part we will learn
        a) How to generate a process involving NLO corrections
        b) How to create the corresponding output for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO
        c) How to run this output for computing NLO corrections

        If you have FastJet (v3 or later) installed on your computer and you wish
        to link it, please update the mg5_configuration file or type
        MG5_aMC>set fastjet /path/to/fastjet-config
        Otherwise the basic fastjet functionalities included in FJcore (shipped
        with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO) will be used.


        Let's start with the first point, how to generate a process at NLO:
        MG5_aMC>generate p p > e+ ve [QCD]
        Note that a space is mandatory between the particle names and that '[QCD]'
        specifies that you want to consider QCD NLO corrections.
        Couplings different than QCD cannot be perturbed yet.


MG5_aMC>generate p p > e+ ve [QCD]
The current model sm does not allow to generate loop corrections of type ['QCD'].
MG5_aMC now loads 'loop_sm'.

        You have just generated a new process.
        You can find more information on supported syntax by using:
        MG_aMC>help generate
        To list all defined processes, type
        MG_aMC>display processes

        If you want to know more about particles and multiparticles present,
        write
        MG_aMC>display particles
        MG_aMC>display multiparticles

        If you want to add a second process, use the add process command:
        MG_aMC>add process p p > e+ e- [QCD] @2

        At this stage you can export your processes.
        This is done simply by typing:

We recommend that you add to the following paths to your environment variables, so that you are guaranteed that at runtime, MG5_aMC will use the tools you have just installed and not some other
versions installed elsewhere on your system.
You can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

Type "launch" to generate events from this process, or see
/pathto/lib/build/hep/MadGraph/MG5_aMC_v2_4_2/MY_FIRST_AMCATNLO_RUN/README
Run "open index.html" to see more information about this process.
tutorial_aMCatNLO:
        If you are following the tutorial, a directory MY_FIRST_AMCATNLO_RUN has
        been created which can be used in order to run simulation including NLO corrections.

        Additionally to the commands in the bin directory (see
        MY_FIRST_AMCATNLO_RUN/README), you can also generate your events/compute the
        cross-section from this interface.
        You will generate events to be showered a la MC@NLO, compute the theoretical
        and PDF error on the fly (if asked for in the run_card.dat) and shower the
        events with the parton_shower MonteCarlo specified in the run_card.dat,
        generating a file in the StdHEP format.
        Please note that, since shower-specific counterterms have to be included in the
        calculation, the parton level sample you will obtain can only be showered
        with the selected MonteCarlo.
        Note also that, because of the way they have been generated, the parton-level
        events in the .lhe file are UNPHYSICAL.
        In order to obtain physical results, please use the .hep file

        Please enter
        MG_aMC> launch

        If you just want to generate the parton level .lhe file, please enter
        MG_aMC> launch -p

        (you can interrupt the computation to continue the tutorial by pressing Ctrl-C)

        At any time, you can access more commands/options for running the output by
        switching to an interactive interface for a given output folder 'MyFolder'.
        You can do so by typing:
        MG_aMC> launch -i MyFolder

        Please see MY_FIRST_AMCATNLO_RUN/README to know about the available commands.
        To know the possible options/modes for each command, simply tiple
        'MyFolder'> help COMMAND
        from the interface bound to the 'MyFolder' output.
