> `PyQ` brings the `Python` programming language to the `kdb+` database. It allows developers to integrate
> `Python` and `q` code seamlessly in one application. This is achieved by bringing the `Python` and `q`
> interpreters into the same process, so that code written in either of the languages operates on the
> same data.
 
> In `PyQ`, Python and `q` objects live in the same memory space and share the same data.

`pyq` is primarily focused on accessing `kdb+` data from `python`
