## Differentiation


Partial derivative of `f`, with respect to `x`:
~~~~
D[f,x]
~~~~

## Complex numbers

> The Wolfram Language usually pays no attention to whether variables like x stand for real or complex

Expanding `expr` assuming that all variables are real:
~~~~
ComplexExpand[expr] 
~~~~

Expandng `expr` assuming that the xi are complex:
~~~~
ComplexExpand[expr,{x1,x2,â€¦}]
~~~~
