# List of `vim` plugins


## [vim-multiple-cursors]

`Sublime` like multiple cursors in `vim`

Default keys:

- `<Ctrl-n>`: Pressing the key in Normal mode highlights the current word under the cursor in Visual mode and
places a virtual cursor at the end of it. Pressing it again finds the next occurrence and places
another virtual cursor at the end of the visual selection. If you select multiple lines in Visual
mode, pressing the key puts a virtual cursor at every line and leaves you in Normal mode.
- `<Ctrl-p>`: in Visual mode will remove the current virtual cursor and go back to the previous virtual
cursor location. This is useful if you are trigger happy with Ctrl-n and accidentally went too far.
- `<Ctrl-x>`: in Visual mode will remove the current virtual cursor and skip to the next virtual cursor
location. This is useful if you don't want the current selection to be a candidate to operate on
later.
